* **Twilio API(free trial)** - For sending Programmable messages to users(In free trial, user needs to verify their phone numbers to get messages)

## Software Used
* **Xampp** - It create a local web server for testing and deployment purposes.

## Environment installation
You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run and [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)/[Mysql workbench](https://www.mysql.com/) for database handling installed on your PC/Mac.

## Approach

To track the Visitors and Host of the office, we are storing the details of the person in the user table which has been implemented using the ORM tool Sequelize.

The project has two different tabs:
* Check In
* Check Out

### Check In
Before a visitor enters the building, they need to fill out the CheckIn form which contains various field like: -
```sh
- Visitor Name
- Visitor Email
- Visitor Phone no.
- Host Name
- Host Email
- Host Phone no.
- Address
```

When the form is submitted by the person, a POST request is sent to the API ```/api/checkIn``` which contains the logic to store the details in the user table using the ORM. The default value of CheckOut is set to **NULL**. This will request node-mailer to send an Email to host to inform about the personâ€™s visit. Simultaneously an SMS will be sent using Twilio API to the host.

### Check Out
A visitor can checkout by providing their phone number here. When the form is submitted by the person, a POST request is sent to the API ```/api/checkOut``` which contains the logic to verify the phone number and updates the checkout time. 

## Database Design
Our database comprises of user table with the following fields:
* visitorName: ```String```
* visitorEmail: ```String```
* visitorMobileNumber: ```String```
* checkIn: ```DateTime```
* checkOut: ```DateTime```
* hostName: ```String```
* hostEmail: ```String```
* hostMobileNumber: ```String```
* address: ```String```
